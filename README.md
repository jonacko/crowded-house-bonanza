## 2. Key features:

- page styled to create a user-friendly interface, includng random backgroud 'weather' image generator
- font styled using Google fonts
- 5-day forecast 'card' display styled using Bootstrap
- search funtion using API call to find current weather of city
- local storage used to store previous searches on page (only saves 1 search currently)


## 3. Issues encountered/further amendments

Please see commented out code for detail of issues/further amendments needed, but summary is below:

- TODO: prompt user to enter correct city name if misspelling/search not found - at the moment the page is unresponsive if this happens.
- TODO: save more than one search to local storage, currently saves only one search at a time.
- TODO: fix styling to avoid bottom blank space on larger screens.
- TODO: add icons to 5-day forecast - currently unsure where to get this data from.
- TODO: optimise for other devices (not in assignment requirements).
